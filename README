Arduino Examples for ADI pre-HackNY Hardware Hacking Workshop
=============================================================

LED_Digital_Trail
 - Simple sweeping back and forth across 4 LEDs

LED_PWM_Trail
 - Sweeping back and forth with PWM
 - Secondary LEDs have lower PWM levels

LED_Var_Speed
 - Digital sweep with speed controlled by potentiometer

LED_Var_Speed_PWM
 - PWM sweep with speed controlled by potentiometer

LED_Var_Speed_Pause_ISR_PWM
 - Variable speed PWM sweep
 - Sweeping can be paused by push button via interrupt
